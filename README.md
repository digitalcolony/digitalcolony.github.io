# digitalcolony.github.io

My GitPages repo.

This is my very first page created using Bootstrap. Isn't it lovely?

## Some History

Way back in 1999, I bought the domain **[digitalcolony.com](https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.digitalcolony.com)**. It sounded cool to me and I wanted a website with a theme of building websites. Colonizing the web. It was the early days of the Internet. Consumer broadband had just arrived.

I used the domain in different ways over the
years. Sometimes it was a business card to get side projects and sometimes I used it to showcase technical
articles and code samples.

With the rise of GitHub, it no longer made sense to use the domain for hosting technical content. So I moved everything over to GitHub. Then I primarily used the domain for email and as a technical portal. But since I already had a personal portal at [MichaelAllenSmith.com](httos://michaelallesmith.com), I just used it for email.

Then in 2017, a company bought the domain from me for a very reasonable price. I moved my email to GMAIL and then used
GitPages to host this page, which is my new technical portal.
